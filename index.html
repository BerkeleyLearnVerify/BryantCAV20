            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bryant/">Randal E. Bryant</a> is a University Professor in the Computer
                Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University. He has been on the faculty at Carnegie Mellon since 1984,
                starting as an Assistant Professor and progressing to his current rank of University Professor of Computer
                Science. He also holds a courtesy appointment in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. He
                served as Dean of the School of Computer Science from 2004 to 2014.</p>
            <p>Dr. Bryant's research focuses on methods for formally verifying digital hardware, and more recently some
                forms of software. He is well known for the development of the ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) data
                structure, used not just for formal hardware and software verification, but also digital circuit testing and
                synthesis, AI planning, and combinatorial optimization. In addition, he has developed several techniques to
                verify circuits by symbolic simulation, with levels of abstraction ranging from transistors to models based
                on first-order logic.</p>
            <p> Dr. Bryant has received widespread recognition for his work. He is a fellow of the IEEE and the ACM, as well
                as a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Science. His awards
                include the 1997 ACM Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award (shared with Edmund M. Clarke, Ken McMillan, and
                Allen Emerson) for contributing to the development of symbolic model checking, as well as the 1989 IEEE
                W.R.G. Baker Prize for the best paper appearing in any IEEE publication during the preceding year. He
                received the 2010 ACM/IEEE A. Richard Newton Technical Award in Electronic Design Automation, the 2009
                EDAC/IEEE Phil Kaufman Award, and the 2007 IEEE Emmanuel R. Piore Award, reflecting the impact his work has
                had on tools used by the semiconductor industry for verifying their designs prior to manufacture.</p>
            <p> Dr. Bryant teaches courses in computer systems and parallel computing. Along with David R. O'Hallaron, he
                developed a novel approach to teaching about the hardware, networking, and system software that comprise a
                system from the perspective of an advanced programmer, rather than from those of the system designers. Their
                textbook ``Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective,'' now in its third
                edition, is in use at over 375 institutions worldwide, with translations into five languages.</p>
            <p> Dr. Bryant spent the 1989-1990 academic year as a Visiting Research Fellow at Fujitsu Laboratories in
                Kawasaki, Japan. He spent the 2014-2015 academic year as Assistant Director for Information Technology
                Research and Development at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). There he worked
                on the National Strategic Computing Initiative, issued as Executive Order 13702 in July, 2015.</p>
            <p>Dr. Bryant received his B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Michigan in 1973, and his PhD in
                computer science from MIT in 1981. He was an assistant professor at Caltech from 1981 to 1984.</p>
