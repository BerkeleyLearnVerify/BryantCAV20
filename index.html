                                <p>Professor Randal E. Bryant, a pioneer in formal methods, is retiring in 2020. A
                                    workshop in his honor is being held alongside the Computer Aided Verification (CAV)
                                    conference on July 19, 2020 in Los Angeles, California, USA. This page provides the
                                    details
                                    about the workshop including a list of invited speakers.</p>

                                <h2>Biography</h2>
                                <p>Randal E. Bryant is a University Professor in the Computer Science Department at
                                    Carnegie Mellon University. He has been on the faculty at Carnegie Mellon since
                                    1984, starting as an Assistant Professor and progressing to his current rank of
                                    University Professor of Computer Science. He also holds a courtesy appointment in
                                    the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. He served as Dean of the School
                                    of Computer Science from 2004 to 2014.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Bryant's research focuses on methods for formally verifying digital hardware, and
                                    more recently some forms of software. He is well known for the development of the
                                    ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) data structure, used not just for formal
                                    hardware and software verification, but also digital circuit testing and synthesis,
                                    AI planning, and combinatorial optimization. In addition, he has developed several
                                    techniques to verify circuits by symbolic simulation, with levels of abstraction
                                    ranging from transistors to models based on first-order logic.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Bryant has received widespread recognition for his work. He is a fellow of the
                                    IEEE and the ACM, as well as a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the
                                    American Academy of Arts and Science. His awards include the 1997 ACM Kanellakis
                                    Theory and Practice Award (shared with Edmund M. Clarke, Ken McMillan, and Allen
                                    Emerson) for contributing to the development of symbolic model checking, as well as
                                    the 1989 IEEE W.R.G. Baker Prize for the best paper appearing in any IEEE
                                    publication during the preceding year. He received the 2010 ACM/IEEE A. Rihard
                                    Newton Technical Award in Electronic Design Automation, the 2009 EDAC/IEEE Phil
                                    Kaufman Award, and the 2007 IEEE Emmanuel R. Piore Award, reflecting the impact his
                                    work has had on tools used by the semiconductor industry for verifying their designs
                                    prior to manufacture.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Bryant teaches courses in computer systems and parallel computing.
                                    Along with David R. O'Hallaron, he developed a novel approach to
                                    teaching about the hardware, networking, and system software that
                                    comprise a system from the perspective of an advanced programmer,
                                    rather than from those of the system designers. Their textbook
                                    ``Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective,'' now in its third
                                    edition, is in use at over 375 institutions worldwide, with
                                    translations into five languages.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Bryant spent the 1989-1990 academic year as a Visiting Research
                                    Fellow at Fujitsu Laboratories in Kawasaki, Japan. He spent the
                                    2014-2015 academic year as Assistant Director for Information
                                    Technology Research and Development at the White House Office of
                                    Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). There he worked on the National
                                    Strategic Computing Initiative, issued as Executive Order 13702 in
                                    July, 2015.</p>
                                <p>Dr. Bryant received his B.S. in Applied Mathematics from the
                                    University of Michigan in 1973, and his PhD in computer science from
                                    MIT in 1981. He was an assistant professor at Caltech from 1981 to
                                    1984.
